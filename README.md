### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
The Name is Louis. I'm a computer science student.  
Currently, I'm working on using Linux more optimally and keeping my Dell laptop from 2008 working.  

You can find out more about me on my [website](https://louisrichard.github.io/) hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  
Or you can contact me at louis.richard@tutanota.com :) I may be slow but I try to check my emails everyday.
