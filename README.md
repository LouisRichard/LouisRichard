### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
The Name is Louis. I'm a computer science student.  
Currently, I'm working on more "artistic" projects ;)

I've master the art of procrastination and being late is what you should expect from me ;)  

You can find out more about me on my [website](https://louisrichard.github.io/) hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
