### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The Name is Louis. I'm a computer science student.  
Currently, I'm working on a router/firewall made with OPNsense.

I've master the art of procrastination and being late is what you should expect from me ;)  

You can find out more about me on my [website](LouisRichard.github.io) hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
