### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
The Name is Louis. I'm a computer science student.  
Currently, I'm working on my portfolio before taking my final exams again.  

I've master the art of procrastination and being late is what you should expect from me ;)  

You can find out more about me on my [website](https://louisrichard.github.io/) hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
