### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
The Name is Louis. I'm a computer science student.  
Currently, I'm working on learning how to use Arch Linux on my laptop.

I've master the art of procrastination and being late is what you should expect from me ;)  

You can find out more about me on my [website](https://louisrichard.github.io/) hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
